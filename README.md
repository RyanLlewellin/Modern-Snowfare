# Coding Standards
## Naming
- Use camel case (ThisIsAnExampleOfCamelCase) when naming (files, classes, functions, etc.)
- Files, Classes, functions start with a capital, variables start with lowercase

## Indentation
- Tabs should be converted to spaces with 4 spaces per tab (this can be done automatically in Visual Studios and many other editors)

## Comment conventions
You should use the following keywords for your comments if they apply. They should all have the format of '@<KEYWORD>(<user_identifier>):'. This is so that they are easily searchable, and we know who commented what if we need futther explanation.
For example, '@TODO(sdsmith):', '@BUG(sdsmith):', etc.

Keywords:
- TODO
- NOTE
- README
- BUG
- STUDY
- IMPORTANT
- DEBUG
- PERFORMANCE

If you think anything should be added to, or removed from, this list, let everybody know.
